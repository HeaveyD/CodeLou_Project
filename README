This project is what I am currently working on for my FEWD class. The website
is about the Pacific Crest Trail. The layout is built using different techniques
I have learned so far. I will update this page as I continue to learn. Feel 
free to offer any tips and tricks or provide feedback on anything I can improve 
on.

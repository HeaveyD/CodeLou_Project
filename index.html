			<span class="summary">
				<p>The Pacific Crest Trail runs from the Mexico border to the Canadian Border. With a length of 2,659 miles with elevations reaching as high as 13,000 feet, the trail is a difficult journey filled with adventure and a diverse array of wildlife and scenery. The trail passes through 25 national forests and 7 national parks from California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia, Canada.<br>
				<br>Most hikers start the trail traveling from the Mexico border on a northbound trek. Planning for the hike can take anywhere from six to eight months requiring thorough preparation and dedication. Hikers also must determine resupply points while they travel, this can be done by shipping supplies to towns, post offices along the trail and visiting local stores. Hikers also work to reduce their pack weight as much as possible to increase the speed of their trek and also to make the hike more pleasant. Hikers on average cover about 20 miles per day. There is no collected data that shows how many people complete the journey through hike but the trail is used by thousand of outdoor enthusiasts for day trips, horseback riding and other recreational activities.</p></a>
